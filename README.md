Conclusion:

This project explored the use of machine learning models—XGBoost and LSTM—for predicting stock prices, providing a comparative analysis of their performance. While both models demonstrated promising predictive capabilities on historical data, it is important to recognize that real-world stock markets are influenced by a multitude of complex factors beyond historical price patterns alone. Market sentiment, macroeconomic indicators, geopolitical events, and unexpected news all play critical roles that cannot be fully captured by price data alone.

Therefore, while models like XGBoost and LSTM can assist traders and analysts by identifying trends and potential price movements, they should be considered as part of a broader decision-making framework rather than standalone predictors.
